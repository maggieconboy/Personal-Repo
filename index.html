        <h2 class="section-title">How I Build Scalable Systems</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 48px; font-size: 18px; color: var(--text-secondary);">
            Most organizations operate on gut feel. I replace intuition with data, and heroic problem-solving with repeatable process.
        </p>
        <div class="story-content stagger-children">
            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>The Problem I Identified</h3>
                <p>
                    At GitHub, my teams faced a fundamental challenge: capacity planning was a guessing game. Leadership would defer commitment because there was no data. Teams couldn't accurately forecast delivery. Stakeholders constantly negotiated scope mid-quarter because nobody could say "here's what we can actually commit to." Every conversation was reactive, not proactive.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-card highlight">
                <h3>The System I Designed</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a two-level capacity framework that separates strategic commitment from tactical execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Quarterly level:</strong> We t-shirt size every epic and initiative (Small, Medium, Large). Each size has a capacity unit value. By measuring our velocity over the past three quarters, we can say with confidence: "We can commit to X capacity units this quarter."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sprint level:</strong> Every issue gets story pointed. Individual team members have a velocity metric. When new work arrives, we can instantly see: "Sarah is under committed this sprint. Can she absorb this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    This transforms negotiations. Instead of "no, we can't do that," the answer becomes "we can do that IF we swap it for this already-prioritized work."
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>The Adoption and Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Adoption:</strong> 18 people across two teams (Salesforce and Zendesk) now operate under this framework. The Sr. Director of Revenue Systems has asked to make it the standard for all new teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Measurable outcomes:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 12px; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Planning cycles are faster and less stressful. Leadership is confident in commitments.</li>
                    <li>When stakeholders ask "can you ship this?" we answer with data, not feelings.</li>
                    <li>Teams can focus on committed work instead of constantly re-negotiating priorities.</li>
                    <li>Early results show improved planning accuracy and faster sprint execution as the team learns to estimate more precisely.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>What This Proves</h3>
                <p>
                    This isn't a one-time fix. It's a repeatable system that:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 12px; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Eliminates the need for heroic problem-solving</li>
                    <li>Scales across teams without requiring my constant involvement</li>
                    <li>Transforms organizational decision-making from gut-feel to data-driven</li>
                    <li>Creates visibility that allows leaders to focus on strategy instead of operational firefighting</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
                    This is the kind of operational architecture a Staff PM designs. Not just for one team, but in a way that other teams can adopt and scale.
