## ü§ñ AI Automation & Copilot

I actively explore how [Copilot Agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents), [Loops](https://github.com/copilot/loops), [Spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces), and [Spark](https://github.com/spark) can fully or partially automate workflows, accelerate product delivery, and drive business impact. My focus is on enabling non-developers to unlock new potential with AI tools.

### üìä Automated Velocity Reporting
This repository demonstrates practical automation through a **[Velocity Reporting GitHub Action](.github/workflows/velocity-report.yml)** that:
- Runs every Friday at 5pm PT automatically
- Analyzes story points from closed issues in current milestones  
- Calculates 3-week velocity averages and trends
- Updates [VELOCITY.md](VELOCITY.md) with data-driven insights
- Posts summaries to project boards

*Example of how AI-driven automation can eliminate manual reporting overhead while providing actionable team performance insights.*
